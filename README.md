# JSON Schema Example Loader

Webpack loader that transforms JSON HyperSchema (without $refs) into a new (completely different) datastructure that contains examples and simplified definitions that you can use in order to create nice API docs.

Do you have references ($ref) in your schemas? Use [@pr0da/json-schema-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pr0da/json-schema-loader) first.
